Cluster Analysis and Model on Southern Literature
Project Objectives

    Classify text by features found in the texts.
    Generate features through unsupervised learning.
    Create a model to predict authorship of a piece of text based on its features.

All pieces of literature were obtained from The Library of Southern Literature, which is part of the University of North Carolina's DocSouth initiative. The library includes some of the most important and influential literature works from the American South. The works are mainly from the late 19th Century and early 20th Century. Newer works are likely omitted due to copyright laws. The pieces used are as follows:

    The Marrow of Tradition (1901) by Charles Waddell Chesnutt
